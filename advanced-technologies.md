# Advanced Distillation Technologies and Process Intensification

## Dividing Wall Columns (DWC)

### Principle of Operation

Dividing Wall Columns represent a significant advancement in distillation technology, enabling the separation of ternary mixtures in a single column shell. The technology integrates the functionality of two conventional columns through a vertical partition wall.

#### Key Components
1. **Vertical Dividing Wall**: Separates the column into two sections
2. **Prefractionator Section**: Initial separation of feed components
3. **Main Column Section**: Final purification of products
4. **Side Withdrawal**: Intermediate product collection point

#### Process Advantages
- **Energy Savings**: 20-30% reduction in energy consumption
- **Capital Cost Reduction**: 15-25% lower investment compared to conventional sequence
- **Reduced Footprint**: Single column vs. two-column system
- **Lower Environmental Impact**: Reduced CO₂ emissions

### Design Methodology

#### Thermodynamic Analysis
The design process begins with understanding the ternary mixture behavior:

```

```

#### Column Configuration Options

**Type 1 DWC (Direct Split):**
