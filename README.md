## Introduction

Distillation is one of the most important and widely used separation processes in the chemical industry, particularly for the purification of chemical mixtures. This process exploits differences in vapor pressures and boiling points of components to achieve separation. From ancient alcohol production to modern petrochemical refineries, distillation has evolved into a sophisticated unit operation that forms the backbone of numerous industrial processes.

## Fundamental Theories and Principles

### Thermodynamic Foundations

Distillation is governed by fundamental thermodynamic principles:

#### Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE)
The basis of all distillation operations relies on vapor-liquid equilibrium relationships. The equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases is described by:

- **Raoult's Law**: For ideal solutions, the partial vapor pressure equals the product of mole fraction and pure component vapor pressure
  ```
  P_i = x_i * P_i^sat
  ```

- **Antoine Equation**: Describes vapor pressure as a function of temperature
  ```
  log10(P^sat) = A - B/(C + T)
  ```

- **Activity Coefficient Models**: For non-ideal systems (Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC models)

#### Relative Volatility
The separation factor (α) determines the ease of separation:
```
α_ij = (y_i/x_i) / (y_j/x_j)
```

Where larger α values indicate easier separation.

### Mass Transfer Principles

#### Two-Film Theory
Mass transfer occurs through:
- Gas-phase resistance
- Liquid-phase resistance
- Interface equilibrium

#### Height Equivalent to Theoretical Plate (HETP)
Relates actual column height to theoretical stages:
```
HETP = H_G + λ * H_L
```

### Energy Balance Considerations

#### Enthalpy Balance
For each stage:
```
H_feed + Q = H_vapor + H_liquid
```

#### Minimum Reflux Ratio
Determines economic optimization point between capital and operating costs.

## Binary Distillation Modeling

### McCabe-Thiele Method

#### Graphical Design Approach
The McCabe-Thiele method provides an elegant graphical solution for binary distillation:

**Key Assumptions:**
- Constant molal overflow
- Negligible heat effects
- Ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium

**Design Steps:**
1. Plot equilibrium curve: y = f(x)
2. Determine feed condition (q-line)
3. Set reflux ratio and construct operating lines
4. Step off theoretical stages
5. Calculate actual stages using tray efficiency

#### Mathematical Relationships

**Rectifying Section Operating Line:**
```
y = (R/(R+1)) * x + (x_D/(R+1))
```

**Stripping Section Operating Line:**
```
y = (L_s/V_s) * x - (B*x_B/V_s)
```

**Feed Line (q-line):**
```
y = (q/(q-1)) * x - (z_F/(q-1))
```

Where:
- R = reflux ratio
- q = thermal condition of feed
- x_D = distillate composition
- x_B = bottoms composition

### Rigorous Mathematical Methods

#### Sorel Method (Stage-by-Stage Calculation)
Iterative solution of material and energy balances for each stage:

**Component Material Balance:**
```
L_(n+1) * x_(n+1) + V_(n-1) * y_(n-1) = L_n * x_n + V_n * y_n
```

**Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium:**
```
y_n = K_n * x_n
```

#### MESH Equations
Modern simulation uses simultaneous solution of:
- **M**aterial balance equations

### Design Methods

#### Shortcut Methods

**Fenske Equation** (Minimum Stages):
```
N_min = ln[(x_LK/x_HK)_D * (x_HK/x_LK)_B] / ln(α_LK,HK)
```

**Underwood Equations** (Minimum Reflux):
```
Σ(α_i * z_i)/(α_i - θ) = 1 - q
R_min = (1/(θ-1)) * Σ(α_i * x_D,i)/(α_i - θ) - 1
```
